            	 DE features,
            	 Eye features: Pupil diameter (mean value, standard deviation, and spectral energy in frequency bands of 0 - 0.2Hz, 0.2 - 0.4Hz, 0.4 - 0.6Hz, and 0.6 - 1Hz); Eye's viewing distance from the screen (approach time ratio, avoidance time ratio, approach rate and average approach rate); Blinking (blink depth, blink rate, maximum blink duration, and total eye - closed time);Eye fixation coordinates on the screen (standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis of horizontal and vertical coordinates, average saccade path length, as well as the mean and standard deviation of the standard deviation for each fixation interval as time - domain features); Some frequency - domain features:(spectral energy in frequency bands of 0 - 0.2Hz, 0.2 - 0.4Hz, 0.4 - 0.6Hz, 0.6 - 0.8Hz, and 1 - 2Hz); Global features (average fixation time and number of fixation areas) ,
            	 PPS features: For the ECG signal, features such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and heart rate spectral energy were extracted. For the GSR signal, features including skin conductance, rate of change of skin conductance, and skin conductance spectral energy were extracted. The skin temperature signal encompasses features like skin temperature, rate of change of skin temperature, and skin temperature spectral energy. As for the respiratory signal, features such as respiratory rate, rate of change of respiratory rate, and respiratory rate spectral energy were extracted.
